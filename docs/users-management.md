# Users management

## Overview

Users management menu is available for django staff and entities admins
only.

Swordphish users management has been built to allow collaboration
within the same team of users.

Visibility can be organised using *entities* and *regions*. *Regions*
are sub parts of *entities*, and you can create them to fit your
organisation.

For example, if your structure is composed of retail banks and
investment banks, you can create two entities 'Retail' and
'Investment' then create sub-regions for every country, like Retail
France, Retail Germany, Investment UK, Investment Asia...

If a user is positioned as admin in an entity, he will be able to
create users accounts and position them in his regions or entities. He
will also see every campaign created in his entities and regions by
every user.

If you position several users in the same region they will be able to
see each others targets lists, templates and campaigns.

## Users

Users interface displays the different users accounts already existing
in Swordphish with a filter based on mail address.

User creation is kinda straightforward, after having filled the form, a
mail will automatically be sent to the user with a temporary password
that need to be changed at the first connection.
